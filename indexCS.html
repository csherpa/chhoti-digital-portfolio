		<p>Hello, Welcome to my page. My name is Chhoti Sherpa. First of all, I would like to claim that I have no prior knowledge about web development. This is a new and challenging field that I have come to admire and respect. Eventhough with low knowledge about this field, I have those qualities that will help me to find success in this program. I am a quick learner who possess good work ethic and good communication skills. I also have few STEM background that's helpful in tech field.</p>
		<p>Aside from communication skills, my ability to work with other is also one of my strength. Currently, my main goal in this program is to learn, gain and apply new technical skills. But through this journey of mine, I hope to successfully complete this program and prepare for further programs to participate where I can apply my skills to build and improve technical projects.<img src="IMG_I.jpg"></p>
